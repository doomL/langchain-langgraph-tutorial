# Tutorial 12: Advanced LangChain Techniques

## Overview
This tutorial delves into advanced LangChain techniques, exploring custom chain development, advanced prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning language models for specific tasks. These techniques will enable you to build more sophisticated and powerful AI applications.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Tutorials 1-11 in the series
- Strong understanding of LangChain components and LangGraph concepts
- Familiarity with Python, async programming, and machine learning concepts
- Python 3.7+
- LangChain, LangGraph, and related libraries installed
- Groq API key (for using Groq as the LLM)

## Installation
```bash
   cd langchain-langgraph-tutorial/Tutorial12
```

## Contents
1. Custom chain development
2. Prompt templating and management
3. Implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
4. Fine-tuning language models for specific tasks

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the `tutorial_12_advanced_langchain_techniques.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure you have set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about advanced LangChain techniques.
