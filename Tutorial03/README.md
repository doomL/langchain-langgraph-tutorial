# Tutorial 3: Document Processing with LangChain

Welcome to the third tutorial in our LangChain and LangGraph series! In this tutorial, we'll explore document processing techniques using LangChain, focusing on loading, parsing, and analyzing text documents.

## What you'll learn

1. Loading and parsing different document types
2. Text splitting and chunking strategies
3. Building a simple question-answering system
4. Implementing semantic search

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorial 1 and 2
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- A Groq API key (sign up at https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the tutorial directory:
   ```
   cd langchain-tutorials/tutorial-3
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install langchain groq jupyter python-dotenv chromadb nltk
   ```

3. Set up your Groq API key:
   ```
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Tutorial_3_Document_Processing.ipynb
   ```

5. Follow along with the notebook to learn about document processing with LangChain!

## What's Included

- `Tutorial_3_Document_Processing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial content and code examples
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the tutorial
- `sample_documents/`: Directory containing sample text files for processing

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to process and analyze documents using LangChain. In the next tutorial, we'll explore the concept of Agents in LangChain.

Happy learning!
