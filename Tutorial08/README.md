# Tutorial 8: Building Complex Flows with LangGraph

## Overview
This tutorial builds upon the introduction to LangGraph, focusing on creating more complex and sophisticated workflows. We'll explore multi-step processes, conditional logic, and error handling within LangGraph flows.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Tutorial 7: Introduction to LangGraph
- Understanding of basic LangChain and LangGraph concepts
- Python 3.7+
- LangChain and LangGraph libraries installed
- Groq API key (for using Groq as the LLM)

## Installation
```bash
   cd langchain-langgraph-tutorial/Tutorial08
```

## Contents
1. Designing multi-step workflows
2. Handling state and transitions
3. Implementing conditional logic in flows
4. Error handling and fallback strategies

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the `tutorial_8_complex_flows_langgraph.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure you have set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about building complex flows with LangGraph.
