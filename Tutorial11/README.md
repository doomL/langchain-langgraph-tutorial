# Tutorial 11: Working with Structured Data

## Overview
This tutorial focuses on working with structured data in LangChain and LangGraph applications. We'll explore how to use Pydantic for data modeling, create structured inputs and outputs, and leverage the JSON Toolkit for complex data manipulation.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Tutorials 1-10 in the series
- Understanding of LangChain components and LangGraph concepts
- Basic knowledge of Python data structures and JSON
- Python 3.7+
- LangChain, LangGraph, and Pydantic libraries installed
- Groq API key (for using Groq as the LLM)

## Installation
```bash
   cd langchain-langgraph-tutorial/Tutorial11
```

## Contents
1. Introduction to Pydantic for data modeling
2. Creating structured inputs and outputs with Pydantic
3. Using the JSON Toolkit for complex data manipulation
4. Integrating structured data with LangChain and LangGraph

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the `tutorial_11_structured_data.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure you have set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about working with structured data in LangChain and LangGraph applications.
