# Tutorial 6: Memory Systems in LangChain

Welcome to the sixth tutorial in our LangChain and LangGraph series! In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into memory systems in LangChain, exploring how to create agents and chatbots with various types of memory for more coherent and context-aware interactions.

## What you'll learn

1. Understanding different types of memory in LangChain
2. Implementing conversation memory for chatbots
3. Creating a chatbot with long-term memory
4. Exploring advanced memory techniques:
   - Summary memory
   - Episodic memory
   - Semantic memory
5. Building a multi-modal memory system

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorials 1-5
- Solid understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- A Groq API key (sign up at https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the tutorial directory:
   ```
   cd langchain-tutorials/tutorial-6
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install langchain groq jupyter python-dotenv faiss-cpu
   ```

3. Set up your Groq API key:
   ```
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Tutorial_6_Memory_Systems_in_LangChain.ipynb
   ```

5. Follow along with the notebook to learn about memory systems in LangChain!

## What's Included

- `Tutorial_6_Memory_Systems_in_LangChain.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial content and code examples
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the tutorial

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you'll have a deep understanding of how to implement and use various memory systems in LangChain to create more intelligent and context-aware AI agents and chatbots. In the next tutorial, we'll introduce LangGraph and explore how it can be used alongside LangChain for even more complex workflows.

Happy learning!
