# Tutorial 2: Working with Language Models in LangChain

Welcome to the second tutorial in our LangChain and LangGraph series! In this tutorial, we'll dive deeper into working with language models in LangChain, focusing on the Groq LLM.

## What you'll learn

1. How to connect to different language models in LangChain
2. Creating and using prompt templates
3. Building simple prompt chains
4. Handling model responses
5. Best practices for prompt engineering

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorial 1: Introduction to LangChain
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- A Groq API key (sign up at https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the tutorial directory:
   ```
   cd langchain-tutorials/tutorial-2
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required packages installed:
   ```
   pip install langchain groq jupyter
   ```

3. Set up your Groq API key:
   ```
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Tutorial_2_Working_with_Language_Models.ipynb
   ```

5. Follow along with the notebook to learn about working with language models in LangChain!

## What's Included

- `Tutorial_2_Working_with_Language_Models.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial content and code examples
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the tutorial

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to work with language models in LangChain. In the next tutorial, we'll explore document processing techniques using LangChain.

Happy learning!
