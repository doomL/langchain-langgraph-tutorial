# Tutorial 4: Agents in LangChain

Welcome to the fourth tutorial in our LangChain and LangGraph series! In this tutorial, we'll explore the concept of Agents in LangChain, which are autonomous entities capable of using tools and making decisions to accomplish tasks.

## What you'll learn

1. Understanding the agent architecture in LangChain
2. Exploring different types of agents:
   - Zero-shot React Agent
   - Conversational Agent
   - Plan-and-Execute Agent
3. Creating custom tools for agents
4. Implementing a multi-tool agent for task solving

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorials 1-3
- Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- A Groq API key (sign up at https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the tutorial directory:
   ```
   cd langchain-langgraph-tutorial/Tutorial04
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Tutorial_4_Agents_in_LangChain.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow along with the notebook to learn about Agents in LangChain!

## What's Included

- `Tutorial_4_Agents_in_LangChain.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial content and code examples
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the tutorial

## Next Steps
