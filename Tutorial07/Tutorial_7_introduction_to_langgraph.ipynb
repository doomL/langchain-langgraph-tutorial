    "\n",
    "LangGraph is an extension of LangChain that focuses on building stateful, multi-step workflows. While LangChain provides building blocks for working with language models, LangGraph allows you to create more complex, graph-based workflows with explicit state management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences:\n",
    "- LangGraph introduces the concept of a 'graph' to represent workflows\n",
    "- It provides better support for stateful applications\n",
    "- LangGraph allows for more complex branching and conditional logic\n",
    "- It's designed for building multi-agent systems and complex decision-making processes"

    "- **Edges** define the connections and flow between nodes\n",
    "- **Graphs** combine nodes and edges to create a complete workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts allow you to create more structured and complex applications compared to linear chains in LangChain."
