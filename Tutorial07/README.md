# Tutorial 7: Introduction to LangGraph

## Overview
This tutorial introduces LangGraph, a powerful library for building complex, stateful workflows with language models. We'll explore the key concepts of LangGraph, set up the environment, and create our first LangGraph flow.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python
- Familiarity with LangChain fundamentals
- Python 3.7+
- LangChain and LangGraph libraries installed
- Groq API key (for using Groq as the LLM)

## Installation
```bash
pip install langchain langgraph groq
```

## Contents
1. What is LangGraph and how does it differ from LangChain?
2. Basic concepts: Nodes, Edges, and Graphs
3. Setting up LangGraph
4. Creating your first LangGraph flow

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the `tutorial_7_introduction_to_langgraph.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure you have set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about LangGraph and create your first flow.

## Next Steps
After completing this tutorial, you'll have a basic understanding of LangGraph and how to create simple flows. The next tutorial in the series will cover building more complex flows with LangGraph.
