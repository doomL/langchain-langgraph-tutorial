# Tutorial 9: Combining LangChain and LangGraph

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to effectively combine LangChain components with LangGraph flows to create powerful, flexible AI applications. We'll build a sophisticated task planning and execution system that leverages the strengths of both libraries.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Tutorials 1-8 in the series
- Strong understanding of LangChain components and LangGraph concepts
- Python 3.7+
- LangChain and LangGraph libraries installed
- Groq API key (for using Groq as the LLM)

## Installation
```bash
   cd langchain-langgraph-tutorial/Tutorial09
```

## Contents
1. Integrating LangChain components into LangGraph flows
2. Building a conversational AI system with both libraries
3. Optimizing performance in complex applications
4. Case study: A task planning and execution system

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the `tutorial_9_combining_langchain_langgraph.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure you have set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about combining LangChain and LangGraph.
