# Tutorial 5: Advanced Agent Techniques in LangChain

Welcome to the fifth tutorial in our LangChain and LangGraph series! In this tutorial, we'll explore advanced techniques for working with Agents in LangChain, focusing on debugging, optimization, and complex workflows.

## What you'll learn

1. Debugging and optimizing agent performance
2. Using the JSON Toolkit with agents
3. Integrating Pydantic for structured inputs and outputs
4. Building complex workflows with agents
5. Implementing error handling and fallback strategies

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorials 1-4
- Solid understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- A Groq API key (sign up at https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the tutorial directory:
   ```
   cd langchain-langgraph-tutorial/Tutorial05
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Tutorial_5_Advanced_Agent_Techniques.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow along with the notebook to learn about advanced Agent techniques in LangChain!

## What's Included

- `Tutorial_5_Advanced_Agent_Techniques.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial content and code examples
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the tutorial
- `sample_data/`: Directory containing sample JSON files for the tutorial

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you'll have an advanced understanding of working with Agents in LangChain and be able to implement complex, robust AI systems. In the next tutorial, we'll introduce LangGraph and explore how it can be used alongside LangChain.

Happy learning!
